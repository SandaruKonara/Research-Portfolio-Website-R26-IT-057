  abstract:
    'Emergency medical conditions such as cardiac arrest, stroke and acute respiratory failure remain a leading cause of preventable death in Sri Lanka, where ambulance response times in Colombo exceed 18 minutes against the WHO benchmark of 8 minutes. Existing wearables and hospital monitoring platforms are reactive, rely on single parameters and depend on infrastructure that is largely unavailable locally. This research presents Safe Band, an integrated IoT and machine-learning ecosystem built around a shared Android smartwatch and Firebase Realtime Database backbone, made up of four independently evaluated components: Emergency Detection, Smart Ambulance Dispatch, Ward Monitoring and Health Deterioration Prediction.',
